# Football_Predictions
This project demonstrates how to create a Flask web application that integrates with the SmartBets API to predict future football matches. The code includes error handling for API interactions and unit tests to ensure robustness. The user interface is designed to display prediction results and error messages clearly using Bootstrap for styling.
